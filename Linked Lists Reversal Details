*** Iterative Method

Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, do following.
// Before changing next of current,
// store next node
next = curr->next
// Now change next of current
// This is where actual reversing happens
curr->next = prev

// Move prev and curr one step forward
prev = curr
curr = next

*** Recursive Method:

   1) Divide the list in two parts - first node and 
      rest of the linked list.
   2) Call reverse for the rest of the linked list.
   3) Link rest to first.
   4) Fix head pointer
