*** Add a node at the front: (A 4 steps process) 
- Time Complexity = O(1)
The new node is always added before the head of the given Linked List. 
And newly added node becomes the new head of the Linked List. For example
if the given Linked List is 10->15->20->25 and we add an item 5 at the front,
then the Linked List becomes 5->10->15->20->25. Let us call the function that
adds at the front of the list is push(). The push() must receive a pointer to
the head pointer, because push must change the head pointer to point to the new node

- Time Complexity = O(n)
