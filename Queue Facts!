* The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.

- In a stack we remove the item the most recently added.
- In a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

Operations on Queue:

* Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
* Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed.
  If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
* Front: Get the front item from queue.
* Rear: Get the last item from queue.
